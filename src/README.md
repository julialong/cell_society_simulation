# cellsociety team 8

Edward Zhuang, Julia Long, and Jeffrey Li worked on this project.
We started on February 1st, and finished on February 11 (early AM on 
February 12th). Julia estimates she spent around 35 hours on this project
in total, including time spent working on the design plan. 

The initial roles laid out in our design plan did not exactly match our actual 
roles, because we initially had very different ideas on how much work different
parts of the project truly entailed. For example, Julia was initially going to work
on the Cell Controller classes, Edward on the UI, and Jeffrey on the different Cell 
types themselves. Our design quickly evolved, and Julia ended up working on the UI,
Edward working on the XML files, and Jeffrey working on the Cell Controllers. We 
all made an effort to help each other out on their parts when necessary.

Julia used [this blog post](http://code.makery.ch/blog/javafx-dialogs-official/) to 
learn how to add JavaFX dialog boxes to the user interface.
